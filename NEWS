February 19, 2002 - Changes in moto 0.9.0 (release j) include:

New Features

    * Added memory debugging code to the main() for compiled pages
    * Synchronized to mman functions

Bugs Fixed

    * Fixed memory leaks from the type checking phase in mod_moto .
    * Gave variables in generated C code default values at declaration time to better mimic the behavior of the interpreter.
    * Made the behavior of printing out null or a null string match the behavior of the compiler by just printing 'null' instead of '(null)'.
    * All known memory leaks / potential memory corruption issues in the preprocessor have been fixed.
    * Fixed some corner cases with regular expression parsing that would cause the parser to segfault.
    * Added Verifier errors for invalid regular expressions.
    * Got rid of all shift reduce conflicts in the parser.
    * Removed all == from the configure scripts and changed all 'test -e's to 'test -f's or 'test -d's.
    * Added and OpenBSD layout for apache configuration.
    * Fixed the two major sources of synchronization problems with the interpreter and compiled modules.
    * Plugged most of the memory leaks in cookie parsing.
    * Made the SharedHeapSize config option work (it now takes the max of all specified heap sizes ... defaults to 32M).
    * Modified setOption so when no value for a config option is given, the option value is set to 'TRUE'.
    * Made the MXPath config option work. In fact, not only does it work now, but it works on a per directory config!
    * Fixed all known memory leaks with file upload (multipart form submissions).
    * Fixed the handling of multiple mime parts sent with the same name. If they are state variables they get concatenated with | in the sv value. In all cases the parts are now available in the enumeration returned by getMIMEParts() .
    * Removed req_getMIMEPartNames() and replaced it with req_getMIMEParts().

 

February 12, 2002 - Changes in moto 0.9.0 (release i) include:

New Features

    * Made the default MX dir be INST_MX_DIR instead of INST_ROOT_DIR/mx allowing the REDHAT layout to put moto extensions under lib/moto/mx
    * Gave the --with-layout feature now defaults --prefix if left unspecified. UNIFIED layout now installs by default in /usr/local/moto, REDHAT layout in /usr
    * Added a new config option for mod_moto : SignalsThrowExceptions. When set to true a SIGSEGV signal gets thrown as an exception (and thus will no longer dump core)
    * Added negated character classes to regex matching
    * Added escape symbol to regex matching
    * Added support for getting and setting client side Cookies
    * Added support for setting outgoing HTTPResponse headers
    * Added much better documentation at the conclusion of mmc (ModOption Location)
    * Changed regexs to Regex's and added Regex.i file to mx/moto
    * Fixed all known functionality issues with the preprocessor (all tests now pass)

Bugs Fixed

    * When regex variables were defined and used more than once memory could get corrupted.
    * The documentation that mmc printed out for installing compiled modules was just wrong.
    * Fixed memory leaks when type verification errors were generated in math expressions.
    * Fixed problems with the extensions path. It can now be set dynamically by using the -X option in the moto binary or using the MXPath environment variable or module option.

    * Fixed a bug that would cause mxcg to report the wrong line number on a parse error of .i files
    * Fixed a bug that would cause moto to return the wrong line number on pages with comments
    * Fixed bugs that caused resultset.getXXX functions to segfault when retrieving SQL Nulls. Numeric return values now return 0 on SQL null. Char values return '\0' on SQL null.
    * Fixed bugs that caused certain form convenience methods to crash if the value specified was NULL.
    * Fixed an annoying bug where a syntax error on one page could effect the parsing of subsequent pages (especially in the module) most often reporting 'Unknown construct $use'

 

March 4, 2001 - Changes in moto 0.9.0 (release g) include:

    * Fixed install script to work against the standard Red Hat installation of Apache.
    * Fixed a number of incompatabilities with includes installed by Red Hat 7 (memsw.h and stdlib.h were not playing nicely together).
    * Added -d option to mmc so that /tmp/mmc directories can stick around if desired
    * Fixed a bug where mmc got confused if multiple versions of apxs were installed

 

February 18, 2001 - Changes in moto 0.9.0 (release f) include:

    * Swapped out semctl for flock. It's slower but better supported and there are no more semaphore leaks. Now when running moto from the command line no locking occurs making it much faster.
    * Fixed calls to sed in aclocal to make things more portable.
    * Changed ar flags for portability.
    * Added generalized TabularData object to persist result sets between page views
    * Added metadata to MySQLResultSet allowing for retrieval of fields by column name.
    * Fixed support for configuring compiled modules inside of Location and Directory directives
    * Added functions to retrieve configuration settings from httpd.conf inside of Moto applications.
    * Fixed shared_calloc
    * Fixed installation support for MySQL. The codex.sql extentions now compile automatically if moto was configured '--with-mysql' and mmc automatically attempts to link against libmysqlclient.
    * Made String comparisons throw exceptions if one of the Strings is null.
    * Fixed error reporting (again) so as not to undercount line numbers when confronted with moto comments.
