Real Quick Install
==================

If you are interested in the moto command line tools only then this
will work for you.

% configure
% make install

Quick Install
=============

To make the most out of moto you should have Apache and MySQL already 
installed. To use moto in combination with these packages type 
the following :

% configure --with-apache --with-mysql
% make install

Additionally, if you would like to use Moto with PostgreSQL:

% configure --with-apache --with-mysql --with-pgsql

Or if your Apache or MySQL installations were installed with a 
--prefix specified :

% configure --with-apache=<path to apache> --with-mysql=<path to mysql>
% make install

By default all moto components will be installed in /usr/local/moto.
To install moto elsewhere on your system:

% configure --with-apache --with-mysql --prefix=<path to moto>
% make install 

When using a prefix you must specify a full path. Bad things can
happen when a relative path is specified

Installing mod_moto
===================

Upon completion of the installation steps specified above, 
copy the mod_moto.so file from the mod subdirectory 
of your moto installation to the libexec directory of your apache 
installation and add the following directives to your httpd.conf:

LoadModule moto_module libexec/mod_moto.so
AddHandler moto .moto 

Then restart apache. All pages with .moto extensions will be
interpreted by mod_moto.
