See the motoBioExtra.tgz which contains example code on how to use 
this library. The bio.defines can simply be included in your code 
for convenience functions.


When working with DIGEST Bios, it is not safe to place them in
the middle of a chain:

ENC->DIGEST->MEM


Instead place them on either end of the chain:

MEM->DIGEST

or

DIGEST->MEM

or 

DIGEST->ENC->MEM


There should really be no need for this, but it is supported nonetheless.
